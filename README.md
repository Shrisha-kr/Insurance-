Insurance Analytics
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to make a claim on their insurance policy during the policy period. Insurance companies invest heavily in optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating claim likelihood, making this an essential area for data analysis and machine learning.

The insurance industry is vast, as car insurance is often a legal requirement for operating vehicles on public roads. Optimizing predictions for claims helps insurance companies to better manage risk and design policies that align with their customersâ€™ needs.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will file a claim based on their policy and personal information. Additionally, we will analyze the key features that influence this prediction.

Data Set
The dataset includes information about customers, their vehicles, insurance policies, and any claims made. The features in the dataset include:

Customer demographics (age, gender, region, etc.)
Vehicle information (vehicle type, age, etc.)
Policy details (coverage type, policy length, etc.)
Claims history (past claims, claim amounts, etc.)
Key Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify important features that influence insurance claims, using visualizations and statistics.
Model Building: Develop machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict the likelihood of claims.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores. Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
Feature Importance: Determine which features (e.g., age, vehicle type, policy duration) have the most significant impact on whether a claim is filed.
Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Impute missing values.
Normalize or standardize numeric variables.
Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize relationships between features and claim outcomes.
Analyze patterns in customer demographics, vehicle types, and policy details.
Modeling:

Build initial models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN.
Perform hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.
Compare models based on evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
Conclusion:

Highlight the model that performs the best.
Summarize insights from feature importance.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Conclusion
By identifying key features influencing insurance claims, this project provides valuable insights for optimizing policy pricing and risk management in the insurance sector. This model can be further enhanced with additional data and advanced algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and business decision-making.

Future Work
Model improvement: Experiment with more complex models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Incorporating more data: Use additional datasets to include external factors (e.g., weather, traffic accidents).
Deployment: Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time claim prediction.
